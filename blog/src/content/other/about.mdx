I’m a software developer with over 4 years of experience working across the stack, from building robust backend services to performant frontend apps. I’ve worked extensively in the JavaScript ecosystem. Besides that, I have hands-on experience with Python, Go, Ruby on Rails, and serverless tech as well.

I'm driven by the pursuit of excellence, a passion for learning new technologies and building systems that scale. Trying to find my footing in the post-LLM world. Rethinking how we build, learn, and collaborate in a landscape that’s changing fast. This blog is my space to explore those ideas. I write to sharpen my own craft, share what I’ve learned, and hopefully contribute something useful to other folks navigating similar paths.
